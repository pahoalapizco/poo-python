# POO with Python :sanke:
Hey there!, in this repo you'll find several exercises that I created following Platzi's course [Curso de POO y Algoritmos con Python](https://platzi.com/cursos/poo-python/)

## Index
- [Coordninates](#Coordinates)

## Coordinates
With this class we can create instances to represente cartesian plane's coordinates and calculate the distance between two points.

### **Usage:**
```py
coord_p = Coordinates(8, 20)
coord_q = Coordinates(15, 36)
distance = coord_p.distance(coord_q)
```
